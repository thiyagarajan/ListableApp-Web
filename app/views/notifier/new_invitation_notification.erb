Hi <%= @created_user.login %>,

Listable user <%= @creator.login %> has shared a list with you titled: 

	<%= @list.name %>
	
<%= @created_user.confirmed? ? "You can see and edit this list by logging in to your Listable account with email #{@created_user.email}.  To log in, go to http://listablebeta.ondemandworld.com/user_session/new" : "You will need to create and confirm an account with the email #{@created_user.email} before you can collaborate on this list.  To create an account, go to http://listablebeta.ondemandworld.com/users/new" %>

The direct link to this list, once you are logged in to Listable, is <%= list_items_url(@list.id) %>.

Thanks,

The Listable Team
